<h2>Configuring Roles</h2>

> [!Note]
> As noted by osTicket:
> "Roles are the permissions granted to Agents per Department that they have access to. Each Role has a set of permissions that can be checked/unchecked for agents given that role in association with a department thay have access to. An unlimited number of roles can be created and assigned to agents with access to various departments." 

> [!Tip]
> Make sure you're on the Admin Panel for this portion. We'll be making a Super Admin with all of the permissions

<h2>Configuring Departments</h2>

Step 2: Click Departments

Step 3: Click Add New Department and Name the Department what you wish. In this example we'll be naming it System Admins.

<h2> Configuring Teams</h2>

> [!Note]
> As Noted by osTicket:

>
> "Having Agents from different Departments assigned to a Team will supersede the parameters of the Agents' Department Rules For Example, you can create a Help Topic Associated with a particular product you produce, and assign it to a Team of specialist Agents from different Departments."

Step 1: Click Agents

Step 2: Click Teams

<h2>Configuring Agents</h2>

> 
> As Noted by osTicket:
> "Agents are given access to the help desk with the intent to respond and resolves the tickets. When adding an Agent to the help desk, they will need to be assigned to a Primary Department and given a Primary Role for the Tickets/Tasks routed to that department. Agents can be given Extended Access to additional departments of the help desk as well as assigned different Roles to those departments; this can be configured in the Access tab of the Agent's Profile."
